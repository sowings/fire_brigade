The family of views in the Retention menu is aimed at helping
administrators visualize and thereby tune various retention parameters
for their indexed data. General information about retention settings
can be found in the Splunk documentation for <a
href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/Setaretirementandarchivingpolicy">version
6.0.x here</a>.
<p />
The time limit settings to force archival for Splunk data are values
given in seconds. Human readable forms of the current archival limit
(known as <code>frozenTimePeriodInSecs</code>) are provided. If the
value is shown with a plus sign (+), the number to the left of the plus
sign indicates a number of days. The right-hand panel in the top row
(titled <em>Cutoff Time</em>) shows the time which is
<code>frozenTimePeriodInSecs</code> ago. Buckets with their latest
events <b>before</b> this time are subject to freezing. If the
selected index is "All Indexes", this row will be empty.
<p />
For the "oldest bucket" panels, 
the "age" of the bucket is taken to represent the span of time from
the <i>latest</i> event in the bucket to "now".
In these panels, the age of the oldest bucket is shown
in seconds (caculated from the time the dashboard loads), and a
human-readable form is also provided. On the right, the oldest
bucket's most recent event (sometimes known as the "latest time") is
shown. This allows easy comparison to 
the cutoff time from the panel above. 
The latest time serves as the
endpoint of the bucket boundary, and dictates when this bucket would
be eligible for freezing (archival) with a time-based retention
policy.
If the original indexer where the data was indexed has been retired or
gone missing, the host field will read as <em>Missing Indexer</em>. In
rows where the <em>Event Count</em> field is zero (0), this represents
a non-searchable "replica" bucket copy.
<strong>For the "Oldest Bucket"
group, thawed buckets are expressly excluded, as they are not governed
by any retention policy.</strong>
<p />
To give administrators an indication of which buckets are the oldest
in the index, a table of the ten oldest buckets is shown. These
represent the candidates for archival, when an archival policy
(whether <em>time-based</em> or <em>size-based</em>) is enacted.
Any buckets that have events (<em>Earliest Time</em> or <em>Latest
Time</em>) that are ahead of the curent time, the marker "(FUTURE)"
will be appended to the vaulues in the <em>Furthest Event Back</em>
and/or <em>Bucket Age</em> fields. <strong>Note: These
"(FUTURE)" markers may indicate problems parsing time stamps of
incoming events.</strong>
For a <em>time-based</em> policy, buckets will not be frozen until
their latest event is further back than the
<code>frozenTimePeriodInSecs</code>, represented on this dashboard as
the <em>Cutoff Time</em>. For a <em>size-based</em> policy, the oldest
buckets are culled until the size of the index is once again under the
limit.
<p />
Below the <em>Ten Oldest...</em> table is one titled <em>Ballast
Buckets in This Group</em>. These are buckets which have a latest
event (against which the "age" of the bucket is evaluated) that is in
the future. This means that the bucket in question is likely to be
skipped (it will not be the "oldest") when selecting which bucket to
move to satisfy the retention policy. This bucket will then take up
space that won't be recycled for use by new data. The table also calls
out the last time that the bucket was written to, to highlight the
possible disconnect with time stamps of ingested data.
