This page employs a REST endpoint introduced in version 6.4 providing
summary information about the disk usage of <i>summaries</i> in the
Splunk environment. These are broken out into two types:
<em>data_model_acceleration</em> summaries, which represent the
artifacts built to "accelerate" a Data Model. The other type are
called <em>report_acceleration</em> summaries, and these represent
accelerated reports. While the underlying data store is different,
both types of artifacts take up space, and may play into retention
policy questions.
<p />
Within the panel titled <em>Datamodel Summary Usage by Model Title</em>, the
column titled <i>Model Title</i> may be a bit cryptic. It is a combination of
the string "DM" (for Data Model), the name of the app in which the model is
defined, and the model's name, all joined with an underscore character. For
example, a Model Name like "DM_Splunk_SA_CIM_Authentication" refers to the
<i>Authentication</i> data model contained within the <i>Splunk_SA_CIM</i>
application.
