This page employs a REST endpoint introduced in version 6.4 providing
summary information about the disk usage of <i>summaries</i> in the
Splunk environment. These are broken out into two types:
<em>data_model_acceleration</em> summaries, which represent the
artifacts built to "accelerate" a Data Model. The other type are
called <em>report_acceleration</em> summaries, and these represent
accelerated reports. While the underlying data store is different,
both types of artifacts take up space, and may play into retention
policy questions.
<p />
Within the panel titled <em>Datamodel Summary Usage by Model Title</em>, the
column titled <i>Model Title</i> may be a bit cryptic. It is a combination of
the string "DM" (for Data Model), the name of the app in which the model is
defined, and the model's name, all joined with an underscore character. For
example, a Model Name like "DM_Splunk_SA_CIM_Authentication" refers to the
<i>Authentication</i> data model contained within the <i>Splunk_SA_CIM</i>
application.
<p />
Continuing down the left column, accelerated model usage is broken out
per indexer (in the panel <em>Datamodel Summary Usage by Indexer
Host</em> and by search head in <em>Datamodel Summary Usage by Search
Head</em>. As a reminder, the model acceleration is bound to the GUID
of the search head (or search head cluster).
<p />
The panels down the right coumn are aimed at report acceleration
summaries. The names of these are even more cryptic than those of data
models! The first part of the name represents the app containing the
report, similar to how a data model is defined. The next section
contains the name of the user who scheduled the acceleration. Finally,
the last piece is the <i>Normalized Summary ID</i> of the search. All
of these are combined with underscores.
<p />
As with the Data Model Acceleration panels, the right column breaks
out the acceleration usage by indexer, and then by search head.
