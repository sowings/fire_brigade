This dashboard can be used to help understand how much data (by its
time span) is available on each index path. Some Splunk installations
will make use of "tiered storage", where the <code>homePath</code> may
have higher performance charactersistics than the
<code>coldPath</code>. In these cases, the difference in speed between
these two storage media will drive retention policies to keep data
that is frequently searched on the faster storage. There are
<i>not</i> specific retention settings in Splunk's
<code>indexes.conf</code> to force this to be a time-based constraint,
so the adjustment of these policies is a "best effort" to achieve the
desired SLA.
