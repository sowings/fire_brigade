This view is focused on identifying buckets which are <i>quarantine</i>
buckets. The quarantine mechanism attempts to keep events which are "too
far" out of alignment with the event times in the rest of the bucket
separate. The parameters which govern this behavior live within
<code>indexes.conf</code>.
<p/>
The names of the parameters help illustrate the principle further:
quarantineFutureSecs specifies how far in the future an event must be for it
to be quarantined. It is always calculated relative to the events already in
the bucket. <b>Example:</b> If an event contains buckets up to Mar 12 2013
09:23:18, and an event arrives dated May 8 2013 13:55:07, this new event
would be quarantined (placed in a separate bucket) given the default value
of quarantineFutureSecs which translates to 30 days.
<p/>
The two top panels in this view provide inspection of these quarantine
parameters. Note that it's rare for these to be customized; they are
provided primarily for informational purposes, and to make sense of the
other data on this page.
<p/>
<p/>
The panel titled <em>Quarantine Bucket Creation Events</em> shows log events
(if any) from the <code>splunkd.log</code> which are emitted when these
types of buckets are created. The <code>timestamped</code> field is in epoch
time format, and can be made easier to read with <code>convert</code> or
