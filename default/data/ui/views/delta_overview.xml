This dashboard provides visibility into the flow of data through the
system. As documented <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/HowSplunkstoresindexes">here</a>, data indexed by Splunk moves through
several distinct phases of its life cycle. Administrators may wish to
track these transitions more closely to understand which retention
constraints are being applied to the data. Further, it can be useful
to understand if the system is in a steady state, where the influx
matches the data being archived out of Splunk, or whether that balance
tips in another direction.
