Occasionally, when managing multiple indexers (particularly if doing
so manually) it's possible for transcription errors to creep in
when setting up indexes. This dashboard attempts to highlight those
misconfiguration issues.
<p/>
The values for a each of a collection of configuration knobs are
collected, and compared to one another. When there are discrepancies,
the values of each are shown in the table. Typically, there should be
only one value for each of the size-based configuration options. The
list of "Indexers w/ This Index" should include the search head, and
all of the search peers.
